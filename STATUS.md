# agent-habitat STATUS

## Current Phase
Phase 1 — Habitat Infrastructure (full plan: docs/ROADMAP.md)

## Current Slice
Slice 3 — Budget caps (config + check + exceed-detection + halt signal)  **— COMPLETE**

## Slice 1 Subtasks
- [x] Scaffold project skeleton + plan docs
- [x] ADR-001: LangGraph over CrewAI (Accepted 2026-05-13)
- [x] ADR-002: Persistence schema (Accepted 2026-05-13)
- [x] llm.py wrapper implementation (2026-05-13)
- [x] Slice 1 live smoke: single Haiku call through llm.py, JSONL telemetry write verified (2026-05-13)

## Slice 2 Subtasks
- [x] Step 0: `stop_reason` + derived `truncated` on LLMResult (committed separately)
- [x] Pydantic v2 models (`Workflow`, `WorkflowStep`, `Event`) + status/level enums
- [x] DDL bootstrap (idempotent `init_schema`) for `workflows`, `workflow_steps`, `events`
- [x] Typed CRUD: insert / update / load / query-by-status
- [x] Cost rollup: `recompute_cost_total` sums `workflow_steps.cost_usd` → `workflows.cost_total_usd`
- [x] Orphan reconciliation: `reconcile_orphan_steps` (startup sweep per ADR-002)
- [x] 33 deterministic tests in `tests/test_state.py`; full suite passes, ruff + mypy strict clean

## Slice 3 Subtasks
- [x] Budget config: `config/budgets.toml` (operator-tunable, stdlib `tomllib`, no new dep)
- [x] `BudgetConfig` pydantic model + `load_budget_config()` with operator-debuggable errors
- [x] `cap_for_workflow_type()` resolution: override wins, else default
- [x] UTC calendar-day window helper (`utc_day_window`) — decision recorded under Open Questions
- [x] `cost_within_window` — SUM over `workflow_steps.cost_usd` for steps with `started_at` in window
- [x] Pure `evaluate_budget(cost, cap, threshold) → UNDER | APPROACHING | OVER`
- [x] `check_workflow_budget()` — composed end-to-end check returning a `BudgetCheck` dataclass
- [x] `record_budget_exceeded()` — writes a structured `budget.exceeded` event into the EXISTING `events` table (no ADR-002 schema change)
- [x] `is_workflow_halted_by_budget()` — `json_extract`-backed halt-signal query for the Phase 2 orchestrator
- [x] 40 deterministic tests in `tests/test_budget.py`; full suite (90 tests) passes, ruff + mypy strict clean

## Open Questions
- **Rate table needs verification.** `_RATES_USD_PER_MTOK` in `llm.py` uses best-known values (Haiku $1/$5, Sonnet $3/$15, Opus $15/$75 per MTok input/output) stamped 2026-05-13. Joseph: cross-check against the public Anthropic pricing page before relying on the cost numbers for any budget decision (Slice 3 enforcement is now wired but reads the same rate table).
- **ADR-002 underspecification: `workflows.id` generation algorithm.** ADR-002 fixes the *relationship* (id is shared with LangGraph as `thread_id`) and the *type* (TEXT PRIMARY KEY) but does not name a generation method. Slice 2 defaults to `uuid.uuid4().hex` via `new_workflow_id()`; callers may override. Revisit with an ADR-002 addendum if Phase 2 needs sortable or time-prefixed ids (ULID, snowflake) for cheap range scans.
- **ADR-002 underspecification: orphan reconciliation target without LangGraph state.** ADR-002 says orphans reconcile to "failed with a synthesized event, or resume." The "or resume" branch needs LangGraph checkpoint state to decide whether resume is safe; that wiring lands with the Phase 2 orchestrator. Slice 2 implements the deterministic half: mark orphan FAILED, set `finished_at=now`, synthesize a WARN event. The resume branch can layer on top later without changing this contract.
- **Slice 3 "daily" definition resolved: UTC calendar day.** "Daily budget cap" = the half-open interval `[today 00:00:00 UTC, tomorrow 00:00:00 UTC)`. Caps reset at UTC midnight. Why UTC over rolling-24h or local-tz: aligns with the JSONL telemetry directory layout (`data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD/` already UTC), is trivially auditable, and makes window queries simple ISO-string range comparisons. Revisit if a workload needs per-tenant local-tz semantics.

## Last Session
Implemented `src/agent_habitat/budget/` — `config.py` (Pydantic v2 `BudgetConfig`, `load_budget_config()` over stdlib `tomllib`, `cap_for_workflow_type()`, and a `BudgetConfigError` with path-named messages) and `tracker.py` (`utc_day_window`, `cost_within_window`, pure `evaluate_budget`, `check_workflow_budget`, `record_budget_exceeded`, `is_workflow_halted_by_budget`, plus `BudgetCheck` dataclass and `BudgetStatus` enum). Bundled `config/budgets.toml` ships default daily cap = $5.00 with `approaching_threshold = 0.80`, and overrides for `lead_enrichment` ($10) and `url_summarizer` ($2). No new dependency — Python 3.11+ `tomllib`.

Halt-signal representation: an ERROR-level row in the EXISTING `events` table with `structured_data` carrying `{event_type: "budget.exceeded", workflow_type, cost_usd, cap_usd, window_start, window_end}`. The halt query uses SQLite's built-in `json_extract` against `$.event_type`. No ADR-002 schema change was required — the events table's structured_data column was designed for exactly this kind of additive use.

Cost attribution by `workflow_steps.started_at` (the day the step *began* is the day its cost counts). ISO-8601 UTC strings sort correctly as text, so the window query is a direct string range scan — no datetime coercion. Boundaries are inclusive lower / exclusive upper (`>= start AND < end`).

Slice 3's actual new work (per the kickoff prompt) was the budget-check + halt-signal LOGIC; actually stopping a running workflow is the orchestrator's job in Phase 2 and not built here. `is_workflow_halted_by_budget` is the primitive the orchestrator will call before scheduling each step.

Tests: 40 deterministic tests in `tests/test_budget.py` — pure evaluator across boundary/edge cases (zero cap, threshold=0, threshold=1, at-cap, at-threshold); UTC window correctness including tz conversion and naive-datetime defensive path; `cost_within_window` inclusion/exclusion at boundaries and isolation across workflows; end-to-end check with override resolution; exceed-event row shape; halt-signal query including the "unrelated error event must not trip the halt" anti-confusion case; TOML config loading including missing file, malformed TOML, missing required key, missing [defaults] section, override without `daily_cap_usd`, threshold out of range, and a sanity-check that the bundled `config/budgets.toml` loads. Full suite (90 tests including llm.py and state) passes cleanly. ruff check + ruff format + mypy strict all clean.

## Next Session Entry Point
Fresh session, Opus high. **Phase 1 Slice 4 — ObservabilityLayer.** Cross-cutting telemetry beyond the per-call JSONL that `llm.py` already writes: structured event emission helpers, cost/latency rollup queries, and CLI-friendly inspection commands so the operator can answer "what did this workflow do, when, and how much did it cost" without writing SQL by hand. Slice 4 should also surface budget status (UNDER / APPROACHING / OVER) and the halt-signal event in whatever inspection surface emerges. Do not touch the orchestrator (Phase 2) or add a web UI (still deferred).
